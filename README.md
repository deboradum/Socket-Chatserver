# Socket-Chatserver

A chatserver using the Socket Python module I created for a university project. It is used by first running the chatserver.py program. The listening port can be changed with an argument. Next, the clients can run client.py on their machine, add the correct port and IP address as arguments and the chatserver is up and running.

The server supports many different commands such as changing your nickname, whispering to a specific user, kicking users, IP banning users and there is a command to figure out the IP address of a certain user.
